						,a software engineer at Facebook.

					<h4 key={5}>Web Development Before React&apos;s Rise</h4>,
					<p key={2}>
						Before React&apos;s arrival, building dynamic user interfaces was a
						formidable challenge. Web applications relied on the Document Object
						Model (DOM) to represent and manipulate the structure of a web page.
						As user interfaces became more intricate and responsive, interacting
						with the DOM directly became a performance bottleneck.
					</p>,
					<p key={3}>
						Facebook, like many other companies, faced the challenge of managing
						a complex news feed that needed frequent updates and re-renders.
						Traditional approaches to updating the DOM resulted in
						inefficiencies and poor user experiences.
					</p>,
					<p key={4}>
						In 2010, Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook, embarked on
						a mission to address these challenges. Walke&apos;s vision was to
						create a library that could efficiently update user interfaces,
						providing a smoother and more interactive experience. This project
						was initially named <code>&quot;FaxJS.&quot;</code>.
					</p>,
					<p key={6}>
						Walke&apos;s <b>key innovation</b> was the idea of representing the
						user interface as a <code>&quot;virtual&quot;</code> DOM rather than
						interacting directly with the <code>browser&apos;s DOM</code>. This{' '}
						<code>&quot;virtual DOM&quot;</code> could be used to calculate the
						difference between the current UI state and the desired state, and
						then efficiently update only the necessary parts of the actual DOM.
					</p>,
					<h4 key={7}>Hackathon: React&apos;s Genesis</h4>,
					<p key={8}>
						<small style={{ color: 'GrayText' }}>
							<i>
								*Hackathon: *Intensive event where developers collaborate on
								software projects within a limited timeframe
							</i>
						</small>
					</p>,
					<p key={9}>
						The turning point came during a Facebook hackathon event in early
						2011. Walke, along with his team, presented a prototype of{' '}
						<code>&quot;FaxJS.&quot;</code>
						{' 	'}
						The project garnered significant interest and attention from other
						engineers at Facebook, leading to a collective understanding of its
						potential.
					</p>,
					<p key={10}>
						Following the hackathon, the project&apos;s name was changed to
						React. The decision to open-source React was strategic, aiming to
						gather feedback from the developer community and drive further
						innovation. React&apos;s first release to the public occurred in May
						2013.
